          I create tailored websites for small businesses and start-ups to help
          them reach bigger audiences
        </p>
        <p>
          My background includes corporate and freelance experience, with a
          history of design projects. I have worked on nationwide and
          international marketing and product launch campaigns for global
          brands. <br />
          Literally, a website needs 4 seconds to give clear message of what is
          it for, what is the target audience and impress the visitor with
          visual appearance. <br />
          Design can fascinatingly change our decisions and emotions. It
          converts website visitors into your customers. So I am here to help
          you with it.
